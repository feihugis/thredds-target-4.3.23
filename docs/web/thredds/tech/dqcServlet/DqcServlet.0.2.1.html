      Version 0.2.1
      <br>
      This software is currently an alpha release (as of 8 March 2004).

<p> The THREDDS DQC Servlet is a framework for providing DQC services.
It can be set up to handle any number of DQC services each of which
consists of a DQC document, the queries allowed by that DQC document,
and the responses to those queries. To use the DQC Servlet for a new
dataset collection and corresponding DQC, requires extending thredds.dqc.DqcHandler (an abstract java
class) and implementing several methods to
handle your dataset collection setup (more details on this below). The
DqcServlet comes with two example DqcHandler subclasses: LastModel and
JplQuikSCAT.<br>
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds/dqcServlet/dqcServlet.war">DqcServlet war file</a> is available from our <a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds/dqcServlet/">THREDDS ftp site</a>. You will need a servet container (e.g., <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Apache Tomcat</a>) in which to install the DQC Servlet.<br>
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install the war file in your servlet container. The defult context
path is "dqcServlet" so if you are running a standalone Tomcat server
with default settings you would access the DqcServlet at
"http://localhost:8080/dqcServlet/".<br>
</p>
<h2>Configure<br>
</h2>
<p>The configuration file (config.xml) for your DqcServlet goes in the
WEB-INF/dqcServlet/config/ directory. The config file is a
ucar.prefs.XMLStore file. There is an example config file
(config.mlode.xml) located in the example/ subdirectory that is setup
to run the two example DqcHandlers. It looks like this:<br>
</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;<br>&lt;preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION='1.0'&gt;<br>  &lt;root type='user'&gt;<br>    &lt;map&gt;<br>      &lt;beanCollection key='config' class='thredds.dqc.server.DqcServletConfigItem'&gt;<br><br>        &lt;bean name='latestModel'<br>          description='Handle DQC requests for Unidata IDD model data on motherlode.'<br>          handlerName='thredds.dqc.server.LatestModel'<br>          handlerConfigFileName='configDqcHandler.mlodeLatestModel.xml'<br>          dqcFileName='dqc.mlodeLatestModel.xml' /&gt;<br><br>        &lt;bean name='jplQuikScat' description='Handle JPL QuikSCAT DQC requests.'<br>          handlerName='thredds.dqc.server.jplQuikSCAT.JplQuikSCAT'<br>          handlerConfigFileName='configDqcHandler.JplQuikScat.xml'<br>          dqcFileName='dqc.JplQuikScat.xml' /&gt;<br><br>      &lt;/beanCollection&gt;<br>    &lt;/map&gt;<br>  &lt;/root&gt;<br>&lt;/preferences&gt;<br></pre>
<p>Each bean in the bean collection represents one DQC service. The
bean "name" identifies this service in the URL and the "description" is
a brief description of this service. The "hanlderName" is the
DqcHandler subclass and the "handlerConfigFileName" is the name of the
config document used by the DqcHandler [<font color="#3366ff">TODO:
currently a config doc is actually required even if the handler doesn't
use one so allow handlerConfigFileName to be empty string</font>]. The "dqcFileName" is the DQC file for this service [<font color="#3366ff">TODO: this should be handled by each DqcHandler as appropriate (e.g., in handler config) </font>].
The DQC document for the "latestModel" service configuration above
would be referenced with
http://localhost:8080/dqcServlet/latestModel/dqc.xml<br>
</p>
<h2>Writing a DqcHandler</h2>
<h3>Minimal</h3>
<p>To write your own DqcHandler, you need to subclass the DqcHandler and implement two methods: <br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>initWithHandlerConfigDoc( InputStream, InputStream), and</li>
  <li>handleQuery( HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) .</li>
</ul>
<p>The initWithHandlerConfigDoc() method can be used to initializes
your DqcHandler. This method is not handled very well and has some
weird requirements; I'll be cleaning it up in a future version. [<font color="#3366ff">TODO: get rid of the two inputStream requirement, implement default version that returns without doing anything</font>]. This method must be implemented in your handler though it is not required to do anything. Two
InputStreams are required because the first handler developed used a
ucar.util.prefs.XMLStore document to store the configuration
information. For various reasons, the XMLStore.createFromInputStream()
method requires two different InputStreams for the same document (not
the same InputStream twice). See the ucar.util.prefs documentation for
more information.<br>
</p>
<p>The handleQuery() method handles all queries to a DqcHandler. From
the HttpServletRequest, figure out what the user is requesting and then
formulate the correct response. [<font color="#3366ff">TODO: decide
what the IOException and ServletExceptions really mean. Is the
ServletException anything on the servlet that makes the request
unhandlable? Is the IOException only for IO problems between servlet
and client or if IO problems happen on servlet, e.g., reading a config
file.</font>]<br>
</p>
<p>See the <a href="./javadoc/">online javadocs</a> for more details.<br>

</p>

<h3>Extended Framework</h3>
<p>I have started working on an extended framework to simplify the
development of new DqcHandlers. This framework provides some classes
for dealing with the allowed queries described in a DQC [<font color="#3366ff">TODO: look at John's thredds.catalog.query package</font>],
user requests, and encapsulation of the backend storage for the dataset
collection framework.&nbsp; Things that might currently be useful are
the SelectFromRange class, the UserQuery interface (the
JplQuikScatUserQuery might be more useful to look at than the
interface), and the BackendStorage interface (doesn't exist yet, see
JplQuikScatDodsFileServer). The rest (and some of this) isn't very well
developed or defined. This will be extended in a future release. <br>
</p>
<p>There are a number of the thredds.dqc classes that are not used
(just things I started trying), i.e., Dqc, QueryAction, and Selection.<br>
