- Deprecate datasetRoot in service element and add to catalog element (??? or dataset element).
- Change catalog@base to catalog@xml:base to conform with XML Base spec
    "The xml:base attribute conforms to the XML Base spec <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/>. It
     allows catalog authors to explicitly specify a catalogs base URI. A catalog's base
     URI is used to resolve relative URIs in the catalog. If a base attribute is not given,
     the catalog's base URI is the URI of the catalog."
- Consider dropping (or de-emphasizing? or deprecating?) the metadata type. Is it used anywhere?

- Version TDS datasetScan document to match schema versions (as with InvCat spec versions)
