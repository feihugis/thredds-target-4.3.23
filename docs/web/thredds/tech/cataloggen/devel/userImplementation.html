<h1>Implementing CrawlableDataset and Related Interfaces<br>
</h1>
<br>
<hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
<h2>CrawlableDataset</h2>
<p>If your dataset collection is not a collection of data files, you
will have to implement CrawlableDataset for your collection before you
can use the TDS catalog generation framework. The CrawlableDatset
interface is fairly straightforward so this shouldn't be too difficult.<br>
</p>
<p>Though not part of the interface, for your implementation of
CrawlableDataset to work in the
"TDS catalog generation framework", a constructor with two parameters
(one a String, the other an Object) is required. The String parameter
is the CrawlableDataset path. The Object parameter is a configuration
object (a single org.jdom.Element) that your implementation can use as
it wishes. This is documented in the javadoc documentation.<br>
</p>
<p>To use your implementation in the "TDS catalog generation framework", simply include a <strong>crawlableDatasetImpl</strong>
element in the appropriate datasetScan with a className attribute that
gives the name of your class. A single child element of the
crawlableDatasetImpl element will be passed to the String/Object
constructor mentioned above as an org.jdom.Element.<br>
</p>


<h2>CrawlableDatasetFilter</h2>
<p>A CrawlableDatasetFilter implementation can be used in the "TDS
catalog generation framework" in a way similar to how a
CrawlableDataset implementation can be used. In this case, the
constructor that is called has a single configuration Object parameter,
again handed a single org.jdom.Element.<br>
</p>
<p>To use your implementation in the "TDS catalog generation framework", simply include a <strong>crawlableDatasetFilterImpl</strong>
element in the <strong>filter</strong>
element with a className attribute that
gives the name of your class. A single child element of the
crawlableDatasetFilterImpl element will be passed to the constructor
mentioned above as an org.jdom.Element.</p>

<h2>CrawlableDatasetSorter</h2>
<p>A CrawlableDatasetSorter implementation can be used in the "TDS
catalog generation framework" in a way similar to how a
CrawlableDataset implementation can be used. In this case, the
constructor that is called has a single configuration Object parameter, again handed
a single org.jdom.Element.<br>
</p>

<p>To use your implementation in the "TDS catalog generation framework", simply include a <strong>crawlableDatasetSorterImpl</strong>
element in the <strong>sort</strong>
element with a className attribute that
gives the name of your class. A single child element of the
crawlableDatasetSorterImpl element will be passed to the constructor
mentioned above as an org.jdom.Element.</p>



<h2>CrawlableDatasetLabeler</h2>
<h3>Used as Identifier</h3>
<p>A CrawlableDatasetLabeler implementation can be used in the "TDS
catalog generation framework" in a way similar to how a
CrawlableDataset implementation can be used. In this case, the
constructor that is called has a single configuration Object parameter, again handed
a single org.jdom.Element.<br>
</p>


<p>To use your implementation in the "TDS catalog generation framework", simply include a <strong>crawlableDatasetLabelerImpl</strong>
element in the <strong>addID</strong>
element with a className attribute that
gives the name of your class. A single child element of the
crawlableDatasetLabelerImpl element will be passed to the constructor
mentioned above as an org.jdom.Element.</p>




<h3>Used as Namer<br>
</h3>
<p>User implementations for dataset naming are not currently supported by the "TDS catalog generation framework".</p>
<h2>DatasetEnhancer</h2>
<p>User implementations are not currently supported by the "TDS catalog generation framework".</p>

<h2>DatasetInserter</h2>
<p>User implementations are not currently supported by the "TDS catalog generation framework".<br>
