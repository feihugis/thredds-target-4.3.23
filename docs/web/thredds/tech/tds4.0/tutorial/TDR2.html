<h1><img src="../images/THREDDSlogo.jpg" height="54" width="67">Create an  Archive with  the Thredds Data Repository (TDR)  </h1>
<hr>
The main focus of the TDS has been to serve near real time data that arrives at a server
by a scheduled delivery system such as our Unidata Internet Data Distribution
(<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idd/">IDD</a>) network.
<p>
    As a complement to this focus, the THREDDS Data Repository (TDR)
    provides client initiated, on demand storage for data to be served by
    the TDS.  The TDR provides functionality to:
<ul>
        <li>store data files and create catalogs</li>
        <li>manage storage space on the server</li>
        <li>upload files via HTTP (and support for gridftp)</li>
        <li>upload a collection of data as single file </li>
        <li>maintain support of repository contents via add, remove, move, copy of datasets</li>
        <li>incorporate metadata provided by the client</li>
        <li>generate additional metadata</li>
        <li>edit metadata</li>
</ul>
</p>
To date TDR development has been steered by two use cases:
<ul>
    <li>the LEAD project
        <ul>
            <li>goal: to provide a publicly accessible repository for published information</li>
            <li>callable via a programmatic client</li>
        </ul>
    <li>the Next Generation Case Study (NGCS) project
        <ul>
            <li>goal: to provide a publicly accessible case study repository</li>
            <li>maintained over time by humans</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<h2>TOUR </h2>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Separate webapp, <code>tdr.war</code>, though integrated with the TDS</li>
    <li>Like TDS, intended to be deployed and maintained by community sites</li>
    <li>One TDR server can have multiple <q>partitions</q>, e.g. <q>ngcs</q> and <q>lead</q></li>
    <ul>
        <li> separate data and catalog spaces </li>
        <li> separate interfaces: ngcs interface communicates with a browser</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans and Ideas</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Scale up</li>
    <li>User interface improvement</li>
    <li>Explore storage options: remote storage, mass storage</li>
</ul>
