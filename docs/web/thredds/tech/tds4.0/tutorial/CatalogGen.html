<h1><img src="../images/THREDDSlogo.jpg" height="54" width="67">CatalogGen: Scheduled Catalog Generation</h1>
<p>The CatalogGen software was originally written for command-line
generation of THREDDS catalogs. It was generally used to schedule
catalog generation for dynamic data collection or for one-off catalog
generation. The CatalogGen servlet was written to provide a simple
interface for scheduling catalog generation.<br>
</p>
<h2>Current Status<br>
</h2>
<p>The CatalogGen software is no longer actively developed (and is only minimally supported). In particular, the
old style configuration format (pre-datasetScan) that it uses is no
longer being developed. We would like to convert the CatalogGen
functionality over to the datasetScan configuration format. However,
with our current resources this is not very high on our list.<br>
</p>
<h2>CatalogGen Servlet</h2>
<p>Since we are moving away from the use of this tool, our
documentation is not up to date. If you decide to try using CatalogGen
or the CatalogGen Servlet, these links might be useful:<br>

<p>The CatalogGen Servlet is only available from the TDS if the remote management and SSL security has been setup. Here is a screen shot of the main servlet page:</p>
