<h2>Java Virtual Machine </h2>
<p>We recommend the latest version of JDK 1.6. This seems to have  performance improvements over 1.5, especially with the <em><strong>-server</strong></em> option. </p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>You should give the JVM as much memory as possible.</li>
  <li>You should run with the 
Java HotSpot Server VM, by using the <strong>-server</strong> oprion. </li>
</ul>
<p>To do so,  set the Java runtime parameters with the environmental variable JAVA_OPTS. For example, add the following to <strong>${tomcat_home}/bin/startup.sh</strong> : </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xmx1024m -Xms256m"
export JAVA_OPTS</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>starts Tomcat with the Server JVM, and gives it 256 Mbytes of memory to start with, and allows a maximum of 1024 Mbytes. These are suggested numbers, use more if you can. The maximum you can give seems to be around 1500m. You  need to restart Tomcat for these options to take effect.</p>
<h2>Tomcat</h2>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>We recommend the latest stable version of Tomcat 6.0, which supposedly has better stability and performance than Tomcat 5.x. This requires JDK 1.5 or above. </p>
<h3>Automatic Startup </h3>
<p>In a production environment, Tomcat should be automatically restarted when the machine starts. How to do this depends on what OS you are running. This <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-tomcat/HowTo">FAQ</a> has a bit of info. </p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Once <strong>thredds.war</strong> is expanded, manually copy everything in <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/initialContent/root/ </strong>to <strong>${tomcat_home}/webapps/ROOT/ .</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>This sets up a <strong>robots<a name="robots"></a>.txt</strong> file to keep crawlers from wasting bandwidth.</li>
  <li> The <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file is mostly a convenience to keep browsers from constantly asking for it (substitute your own icon if you like!). </li>
</ol>

<h2>Thredds Data Server </h2>
<h3>File Handles and Caching </h3>
<p>The TDS caches file handles to minimize OS overhead. Currently this defaults to allow   200 - 400 open files for OPeNDAP and WCS, and 25 - 40 for HTTP file serving. This means that your OS must allow at least that many file handles per process, else you can get a &quot;out of file handles&quot; message, and the server may freeze up. </p>
<p>These numbers limit performance, but not functionality. For example, the number of files in an aggregation is not limited by these file handle limits. </p>
<p>You can change these settings in the <a href="../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html">threddsConfig.xml</a> file. </p>
<h3>Consolidate cache / temporary directories</h3>
<p>The TDS writes temporary files and caches files. By default these are stored under <strong>${tomcat_home}/content/thredds/. </strong>These directories can get large. You might want to relocate them to another place, for example if <strong>${tomcat_home}</strong> has limited space. Also, theres no  need to backup the cache directories, so they can be placed on a disk that is not backup up. To move these directories, see <a href="../reference/ThreddsConfigXMLFile.html">TDS Configuration with threddsConfig.xml</a>.</p>
<h3>OPeNDAP Memory Use</h3>
<p>The OPeNDAP-Java layer of the server currently has to read the entire data request into memory before sending it to the client (we hope to get a streaming I/O solution working eventually). Generally clients only request subsets of large files, but if you need to support large data requests, make sure that the <em><strong>-Xmx</strong></em> parameter above is set accordingly. </p>
<h3>Pre-indexing GRIB files</h3>
<p>If you are serving GRIB files through any of the subsetting services (OPENDAP, WCS, etc), the CDM must write an index the first time it tries to read it. This can take several minutes for very large GRIB files. By <a href="IDDconfig/tdsidd.html#grib">indexing GRIB files</a> before they are accessed, users get much faster response time.</p>
<h2>Data File Disk Access</h2>
<p>Generally the TDS will be I/O bound, and its speed will be determined by the speed of its disk access. Typically disk access is faster on a local drive than on an NFS mounted drive. High performance disk subsystems like RAID or SANs can also significantly improve TDS throughput. However, its best to measure performance of alternate hardware configurations.</p>
