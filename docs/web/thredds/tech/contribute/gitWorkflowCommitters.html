<h1>Git Workflow: Authorized Committers</h1>

<p>
  If you are authorized to commit to the Unidata/thredds repository, ...
</p>

<h2>Overview of Workflow</h2>
<p>
  Now that you have identified an issue or feature to work on, these are
  the steps we follow to commit changes to the Unidata thredds
  repository on gitHub.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure your local repository is up to date with Unidata/thredds repository (origin):
    <ul>
      <li>If you are new to working on the THREDDS code:
        <ul>
          <li>Clone the Unidata/thredds repository to create a local copy of the repository.</li>
          <li>Check out the current development branch ("target-4.3.13" as of 6 Aug 2012)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you already have a fork and a local repository:
        <ul>
          <li>Fetch any changes from origin.</li>
          <li>If there are changes from origin/target-4.3.13:
            <ul>
              <li>Merge those commits onto local/target-4.3.13.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a local branch (e.g., local/myCoolFix) off of the current development
    branch (origin/target-4.3.13)</li>
  <li>Make changes to code, commit changes frequently to your local branch ("myCoolFix").</li>
  <li>Make sure your branch is up to date with origin/target-4.3.13.
    <ul>
      <li>Fetch any commits from origin/target-4.3.13.
      <li>If there are changes from origin/target-4.3.13, merge those commits into local/target-4.3.13.</li>
      <li>Rebase local/myCoolFix onto, the now up-to-date, local/target-4.3.13.
        [NOTE: Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history, as desired.]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Repeat the last two steps as needed.</li>
  <li>Once you have tested your changes locally and want to share your changes with the
    rest of the development team:
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure your branch is up to date with origin/target-4.3.13 ...</li>
      <li>Push your changes from local/myCoolFix to origin/target-4.3.13</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Update your local development branch:
    <ul>
      <li>Checkout the development branch, local/target-4.3.13</li>
      <li>Pull from origin/target-4.3.13</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Remove local/myCoolFix branch</li>
</ol>
