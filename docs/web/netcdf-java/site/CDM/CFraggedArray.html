<p> To save space in the netCDF file, it may be  			desirable to eliminate points from data arrays  			that are invariably missing. Such a compression  			can operate over one or more adjacent axes, and  			is accomplished with reference to a list of the  			points to be stored. The list is constructed by  			considering a mask array that only includes the  			axes to be compressed, and then mapping this array  			onto one dimension without reordering. The list is  			the set of indices in this one-dimensional mask  			of the required points. In the compressed array,  			the axes to be compressed are all replaced by a  			single axis, whose dimension is the number of  			wanted points. The wanted points appear along  			this dimension in the same order they appear in  			the uncompressed array, with the unwanted points  			skipped over. Compression and uncompression are  			executed by looping over the list. </p>
<p> The list is stored as the coordinate variable  			for the compressed axis of the data array. Thus,  			the list variable and its dimension have the same  			name. The list variable has a string attribute  			compress, <em>containing a blank-separated list  			of the dimensions which were affected by the  			compression in the order of the CDL declaration  			of the uncompressed array</em>. The presence of  			this attribute identifies the list variable  			as such. The list, the original dimensions  			and coordinate variables (including boundary  			variables), and the compressed variables with  			all the attributes of the uncompressed variables  			are written to the netCDF file. The uncompressed  			variables can be reconstituted exactly as they  			were using this information. </p>

  <p><strong>Example 8.3. Ragged 2D array</strong></p>
  <div>
    <p> We eliminate sea  					 points at all depths in a  					 longitude-latitude-depth array of  					 soil temperatures. In this case,  					 only the longitude and latitude  					 axes would be affected by the  					 compression. We construct a list  					 landpoint(landpoint) containing  					 the indices of land points. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre>dimensions:<br />  londim = 128 ;<br />  latdim = 64 ;<br />  rgrid = 6144 ;<br /><br />variables:<br />  float PS(rgrid) ;<br />    PS:long_name = &quot;surface pressure&quot; ;<br />    PS:units = &quot;Pa&quot; ;<br />    PS:coordinates = &quot;lon lat&quot; ;<br /><br />  float lon(rgrid) ;<br />    lon:long_name = &quot;longitude&quot; ;<br />    lon:units = &quot;degrees_east&quot; ;<br /><br />  float lat(latdim) ;<br />    lat:long_name = &quot;latitude&quot; ;<br />    lat:units = &quot;degrees_north&quot; ;<br /><br /><strong>  int rowSize(latdim);<br />    rgrid:ragged= &quot;latdim londim&quot;;<br />    rgrid:desc= &quot;number of longitudes for each latitude row&quot;;</strong><br /> 
    </pre>
    <p> Since   					landpoint(0)=363,   					for instance, we know that   					landsoilt(*,0)   					maps on to point 363 of the original data with dimensions   					(lat,lon).   					This corresponds to indices   					(3,75),   					i.e.,   					363 = 3*96 + 75. </p>
