<h1>HTTP Processing</h1>
<p>The Netcdf-Java library uses the Apache <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html">HttpClient 3.1 library</a> for almost all HTTP processing (a small number of utilities use the java.net package).
HttpClient is used to access OPeNDAP datasets, for WCS, WMS, and CdmRemote access, and to <a href="./HTTPservice.html">open remote files served over HTTP</a>.
The Netcdf-Java library provides <strong>ucar.nc2.util.net.HttpClientManager</strong> to manage HttpClient settings.
Future versions of the Netcdf-Java library will use <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">HttpComponents</a>, which is commonly called the httpclient-4 library.
It is the successor to HttpClient library 3.
The HttpClientManager API will be kept as backwards compatible as possible.
<p>You can allow default HttpClient settings to be used, unless you need to use HTTP Authentication to access restricted datasets.

<h2>Setting a Proxy Server</h2>
<p>To use a proxy server, set the System properties <strong>http.proxyHost </strong>and<strong> http.proxyPort</strong> before making any calls to the  Netcdf-Java library.
One way to do this is to set them on the command line:
<pre>java -D<strong>http.proxyHost</strong>=hostname -D<strong>http.proxyPort</strong>=80 -classpath ...
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, one can set the proxy host and port programmatically
using this procedure.
<pre>
HTTPSession.setGlobalProxy(String host, int port)
</pre>

<h2>HTTP Authentication </h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>When dataset access must be restricted to authorized
users, the server will issue an <em>HTTP authentication
challenge</em>.
We call these <strong><em>restricted datasets</em></strong>.
The HttpClient library handles the
details of the HTTP protocol, but the application layer must
be responsible for supplying the <em>credentials</em> that
authenticate the user.
<strong>If you want to access restricted datasets with the  Netcdf-Java library, you must plug-in a <em>CredentialsProvider </em>object </strong>(see <a href="#CredentialProvider">below</a>).

<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p><em>Authentication</em> means establishing the identity of a user.
In most cases, this is done with a user name and password.
A stronger way to do this is to use digital signatures with client certificates:
a fairly complex process.
The Netcdf-Java library supports HTTP Basic and Digest Authentication, with or without Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. It also supports client-side
keys with SSL encryption.
Its up to the server to decide which kind of HTTP authentication is needed.
<p>
If you are writing an interactive client application, you
might prompt the user for the user name and password.  A
non-interactive application needs to have some kind of a
lookup table or database to supply the information.
<p>
As of version 4.3, the netcdf-java client side code manages
such a databse for you.
The key idea is that a single, global database of
credentials is maintained. The key for the database is the
combination of the authorization scheme plus a url. This key
pair maps to an instance of a CredentialsProvider (typically provided
by a user).
At the time an HTTP method (Get, Put, etc.)
is executed, the url indicates when to apply
authorization (if the server requests it). The scheme
indicates the kind of authorization scheme that is being used:
HTTP Basic or Digest for example. The credentials provider
is then invoked to compute the set of credentials to be sent
to the server.
<p>
Currently the following schemes are supported.
<ul>
<li>Basic: the HTTP Basic scheme based on clear-text user name and password.
<li>Digest: the HTTP digest scheme based on encrypted user name and password.
<li>SSL: a scheme that uses a client-side key to
authenticate the client to the server. The ssl scheme is
usually part of an SSL connection where the server
authenticates to the client and then the client
authenticates to the server.
</ul>
See the file <a href="./Session.html#Credentials">Session.html</a>
for details.

<h3>Authorization </h3>

<p>Having established a user's identity,
<em>authorization</em> is the process of deciding if that
user has the right to access a particular dataset.  Most
servers, including the THREDDS Data Server (TDS), use
<em>role-based authorization</em>.  When a user is logged
into a particular server, access is granted based on what
<em>roles</em> the user has been given by that server.  The
practical effect of this is that if the user doesnt have
access rights to a dataset, they are not prompted to enter a
different username/password.  They have to logout and login
as a different user.

<h3>Sessions</h3>

<!--Typically a user makes several or many requests to get
data from a particular dataset.  Some servers (like the TDS)
establish a session that keeps track of a user, so that the
user doesn't have to send the username/password with each
request.  A session is enabled by sending a <em>Session
Cookie</em> between the server and client.  The session
remains established based on the rules of Cookie processing
and HTTP Protection Spaces.  This means that every time a
restricted dataset is opened, the application layer may be
asked for user credentials for that dataset.  Once
authentication and authorization is established, no further
prompting is made while the dataset is open, as long as the
session doesnt time out.  Typically a session times out if
there is no activity on it for some time, e.g.  30
minutes.-->

As of 4.3, the notion of a session has changed.
A session is encapsulated in an instance of the class
<i>HTTPSession</i>. See the Session.html document for more
information.
<p>
The session url in effect defines the <i>role</i>
of the client. It can specify a host, port, user, and a path.
Entries in the client-side authorization database
are keyed on the scheme (BASIC, DIGEST, etc) and the url.
The url may specify wildcards by omitting various elements of the url.
<p>
Servers that don't use sessions or other methods may require
that the username/password be sent with every request.
This is handled automatically because <i>HTTPSession</i>
properly caches previously constructed credentials.

<h3>Plugging in a CredentialsProvider<a name="CredentialProvider"></a></h3>

<p> In order to access restricted datasets with the
Netcdf-Java library, you must plug-in a
<em>CredentialsProvider</em> that implements the <strong><a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/index.htm">org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.CredentialsProvider</a></strong>
interface, which has one method:

<pre>public <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/Credentials.html" title="interface in org.apache.commons.httpclient">Credentials</a> <b>getCredentials</b>(<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/auth/AuthScheme.html" title="interface in org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth">AuthScheme</a>&nbsp;scheme,
                           String&nbsp;host,
                           int&nbsp;port,
                           boolean&nbsp;isproxy)
                           throws <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/auth/CredentialsNotAvailableException.html" title="class in org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth">CredentialsNotAvailableException</a>
</pre>
<p>You can write your own, or, for GUI programs, use the <strong>thredds.ui.UrlAuthenticatorDialog</strong> class, which pops up a Dialog Box, similar to how FireFox and other browsers work.
<p>
You can set the credentials provider globally for all requests
or for a requests to specific urls.
Globally for all requests means that the credentials provider will be used for all instances
of <i>HTTPSession</i>. An example of this would be as follows.
<pre>
CredentialsProvider provider = new thredds.ui.UrlAuthenticatorDialog(frame);
HTTPSession.setGlobalCredentialsProvider(provider);
</pre>
Alternately, you could specify that a url defining when the provider should be
used.
<pre>
HTTPSession.setGlobalCredentialsProvider(HTTPAuthScheme.BASIC,"http://hostx.org",provider);
</pre>
In this case, this provider is used when BASIC authorization is being used
but only for servers on the machine "hostx.org"

<h3>Initializing</h3>
<p>
The Netcdf-Java class
<strong>ucar.nc2.util.net.HttpClientManager</strong> is a
static class that provides a wrapping around HTTPSession to
provide a number of useful methods that simplify various
common operations.
You must first initialize it using the static init method.
<pre>
static public void init(CredentialsProvider provider, String userAgent);
</pre>
The <strong>userAgent</strong> should be the name of your
Application, which is added to the HTTP User-Agent header,
and allows servers to track which applications are accessing
it.
<p>
After initialization, you may invoke any of the <i>HttpClientManager</i>
static methods to perform common tasks.
Most of these methods have an instance of <i>HTTPSession</i>
as an argument, but it is optional. If the value null is provided,
the <i>HttpClientManager</i> will create and destroy its own instances.
<p>
If you have an idea for additional common operations
for the <i>HttpClientManager</i> interface, feel free to send them
to Unidata support.
