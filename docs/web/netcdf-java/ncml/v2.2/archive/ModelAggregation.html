<h1>Aggregation for Model Runs</h1>
<p><em>last changed: Feb 28, 2006</em></p>
<h2>Forecast Model Run</h2>
<p>A <em><strong>forecast model </strong></em>is a scientific model that predicts the time evolution of a system starting from some initial state. Its output is a time series for each of its variables, which may be state variables or derived variables. The model is often run periodically, so one may have a collection of different runs. The collection of data output for a particular model run is called a <em><strong>ForecastModelRun</strong></em>, which for now we will assume are placed in a single file.  The model is run periodically, and so one may have a <em><strong>collection of ForecastModelRun files</strong></em> (aka a <em><strong>ForecastModelRunCollection),</strong></em> which we assume can be uniquely identified by the date of the model run, called the <em><strong>modelRunDate</strong></em>. </p>
<p>The time series for a ForecastModelRun is the list of <em><strong>forecast dates</strong></em>. (For our purposes here, the forecast dates are just whatever the time series is, ignoring whether its a forecast or a nowcast, etc.) </p>
<p>For example, in the following chart, a ten day forecast 
    making
  daily output snapshots is made once a day and a ForecastModelRun file is generated each day. A ForecastModelRun  corresponds to all the times in a vertical column in Figure 1: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><strong> Figure 1. Collection of Forecast Model Runs </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we  assume that all of the 
ForecastModelRun  is  in a single file, then you dont need an NcML aggregation to view it, just open it as a regular NetCDF file. </p>
<h2>Constant Forecast Date</h2>
<p>You also might want to 
view the 
 collection of ForecastModelRun
files
 along a horizontal row in Figure 1, i.e.  successively shorter
forecasts of the same endpoint.  The final timestep of each is actually a nowcast (where T=0 for the run).&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of this aggregation is to evaluate forecast skill.&nbsp; Imagine an anomaly field that you create by subtracting the final time step (the nowcast state estimate) from each of the forecasts.&nbsp; How rapidly does the time series at each spatial point approach zero? </p>
<p>To create these datasets from a collection of ForecastModelRun files, you can use the <em><strong>forecastModelRun</strong></em> aggregation type with  <em><strong>forecastDate </strong></em>and<em><strong> forecastDateVariable</strong></em> attributes: </p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;netcdf xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2&quot;&gt;<br>  &lt;aggregation dimName=&quot;record&quot; type=&quot;<strong>forecastModelRun</strong>&quot; <strong>forecastDate=&quot;2005-12-16 12:00:00&quot; forecastDateVariable=&quot;valtime&quot;</strong>&gt;<br>    &lt;scan location=&quot;C:/data/ncmodels/&quot; suffix=&quot;.nc&quot; enhance=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;/aggregation&gt;<br>&lt;/netcdf&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <strong>forecastDate</strong> must be an ISO 8601 formatted date, or a <strong>udunit</strong> date unit, eg &quot;122100 hours since 1992-1-1&quot;. You must also name the variable that holds the forecast date in the <strong>forecastDateVariable</strong> attribute. This variable must either be of type <strong>String</strong> or <strong>char</strong> and hold ISO 8601 dates, or it must have a <em><strong>udunit</strong></em> date unit string in its units attribute, for example:</p>
<pre> double valtime(record);<br>     :long_name = &quot;forecast valid time&quot;;<br>     :units = &quot;hours since 1992-1-1&quot;;</pre>
<p>The above example scans a directory. You may also explicitly list the datasets:</p>
<pre>&lt;aggregation dimName=&quot;record&quot; type=&quot;<strong>forecastModelRun</strong>&quot; <strong>forecastDate=&quot;2005-12-16 12:00:00&quot; forecastDateVariable=&quot;valtime&quot;</strong>&gt;<br>  &lt;netcdf location=&quot;/my/data/modelrun01.nc&quot;&gt;<br>  &lt;netcdf location=&quot;/my/data/modelrun02.nc&quot;&gt;<br>  &lt;netcdf location=&quot;/my/data/modelrun03.nc&quot;&gt;<br>&lt;/aggregation&gt;<br> 
</pre>
<h2>Constant Forecast Offset </h2>
<p>Finally, you  might want to view the dataset along a diagonal  in Figure 1, e.g. all the 3 day forecast snapshots from all your model runs. 
Imagine a plot showing two time series.&nbsp; One time series is the purple diagonal (time series of best state estimate) in Figure 1. The other is (for example) the time series of 3-day forecasts.&nbsp; Sometimes the 3-day forecast will track the state estimate; other times it will be off.&nbsp; This time series view allows the model diagnostician to ask "When does my forecast model fail?"&nbsp; </p>
<p>To create these datasets from a collection of ForecastModelRun files, you can use the <em><strong>forecastModelRun</strong></em> aggregation type, with either a  <em><strong>forecastOffset</strong></em> or a <em><strong>forecastTimeOffset</strong></em> attribute. A <strong>forecastOffset</strong> is an index offset from the start of each ForecastModelRun. This should work when the times of your ForecastModelRun
files remain uniform from file to file.</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;netcdf xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2&quot;&gt;<br>  &lt;aggregation dimName=&quot;record&quot; type=&quot;<strong>forecastModelRun</strong>&quot; <strong>forecastOffset</strong>=<strong>&quot;0&quot;</strong>&gt;<br>    &lt;scan location=&quot;C:/data/ncmodels/&quot; suffix=&quot;.nc&quot; enhance=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;/aggregation&gt;<br>&lt;/netcdf&gt;</pre>
<p>  Alternatively, you can specify a time  in the <strong>forecastTimeOffset</strong> attribute:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;netcdf xmlns=&quot;http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2&quot;&gt;<br>  &lt;aggregation dimName=&quot;record&quot; type=&quot;<strong>forecastModelRun</strong>&quot; <strong>forecastTimeOffset</strong>=<strong>&quot;1 day&quot;</strong> <strong>forecastDateVariable=&quot;valtime&quot;</strong> 
      <strong>referenceDateVariable=&quot;reftime&quot;</strong>&gt;
<br>    &lt;scan location=&quot;C:/data/ncmodels/&quot; suffix=&quot;.nc&quot; enhance=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;<br>  &lt;/aggregation&gt;<br>&lt;/netcdf&gt;</pre>
<p>The <strong>forecastTimeOffset</strong> attribute value must be a <em><strong>udunit</strong></em> time unit. You must also name the variables that hold the forecast and reference time in the <strong>forecastDateVariable</strong> and the <strong>referenceDateVariable </strong>attributes<strong>. </strong>The forecastDate will be chosen which differs from the modelRunDate by <strong>forecastTimeOffset</strong> amount of time. As above,  these variables must  either be of type <strong>String</strong> or <strong>char</strong> and hold ISO 8601 dates, or must have a <em><strong>udunit</strong></em> date unit string in their units attribute.</p>
