1/24/2012 time unit is month

 - My message 1/23/2012
     We are seeing some NDFD GRIB2 records that may be incorrect.  In short,
     the time unit is encoded as a "3" meaning "Month" so that the forecast
     intervals are as many as 13 months out. Possibly that should be "Days" ?

     Attached is a sample record that came in on the conduit feed for the
     20120119_1800 run. below is a dump of the info in it.

    This file contains a 3-month (seasonal) probability of below average precipitation produced by CPC.

    These 3-month grids are encoded with a time range indicator of 3 (months) and the number of months from the reference time
    to the end of the 3-month valid period.  NDFD currently contains 3-month probability grids that go out to May 1, 2013.

 - my note back to Davis:

     Hi David:

    Thanks much for the clarification, i didnt realize such long range forecasts were possible.

    1) Its possible we are misclassifying these as part of the NDFD dataset as they come to us on the CONDUIT datafeed. Are they part of NDFD?

    If so, is there a simple way (eg WMO header) to distinguish these fields from the other NDFD variables?

    2) I am interpreting the time range intervals, eg from the 2012-01-19T18:00 run as :

     (0.000000, 1.000000) == (2012-01-19T18:00:00.000Z, 2012-02-19T18:00:00.000Z)

    does that seem correct to you?
