Notes on NCEP model data on motherlode

01/12/2012 reviewing the TDS use of motherlode IDD model data (with Tom, Robb, Jeff W):

 the following are not being served. do we want to serve?

    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/ECMWF  (Global_2p5) 		    [useless] available in nc format, not served, not requested, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCAR/AMPS/WRF 			    [would like to see] don't know about
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Ensemble_1p25deg 	[serve it] tiled grid, not served, not requested, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Extended_Global_5p0deg[no opinion] available in nc format but not served, no requests, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Global_1p25deg		[serve it] tiled grid, not served, not requested, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Spectral_1p25deg	    [no opinion] tiled grid, not served, not requested, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NAM/Firewxnest		    [yes yes yes] available in raw format, not served yet
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NDFD/Fireweather/CONUS	[is this real yet?] available in raw format, not served yet
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/OCEAN			        [no opinion] tiled grid, available in nc format, not served, not requested, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/RTMA			            [serve it] already served in TDS
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/SPECTRAL			        [no opinion] tiled grid, available in raw format, not served, not requested, don't serve
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/SST                      [serve it] available in nc format, already served in TDS
    /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/UKMET/thin			        [could cull] tiled grids, not served, not requested, don't serve
   
 from Robb:
   Many of the above grids that are not served are the older type grids
   that haven't be requested for awhile. Also some were tiled grids that the
   TDS doesn't served unless they are decoded by gribtonc, ie SST. Others
   were already being served ie RTMA.  The new grids are the Firewxnest and
   maybe the Fireweather NDFD if it has good data in it, should be served. I
   don't want to make available old products because they haven't been
   requested and the new products; quarter degree grids are soon to appear and
   they are 12G verses the 3G for half degree and space will be needed on ML
   We will stop storing some of the above grids as there hasn't been an
   request in awhile.


Decided dont serve:

  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/ECMWF  (Global_2p5)
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Ensemble_1p25deg
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Extended_Global_5p0deg
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Global_1p25deg
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/GFS/Spectral_1p25deg
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/OCEAN
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/SPECTRAL
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/SST
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/UKMET/thin

Added:
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCAR/AMPS/WRF
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NAM/Firewxnest
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/NDFD/Fireweather/CONUS
  /data/ldm/pub/native/grid/NCEP/RTMA  (actually already there)
